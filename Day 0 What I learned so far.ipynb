    "><font color=green>“Face the light so the shadow will be behind you”</font>. Face the problem, yes there will be struggle and pain on learning new stuff.  Embrace it like the pain you are building a muscle or like playing a video game. At first you are not so good but with practice and patience you will be better. Persevere, have a growth mindset (remember your why did you started, who you want to be), stop, breathe, reflect if what you are doing is effective or not.  Make the necessary adjustment, experiment and apply then re-evaluate again. \n",

    "\n",
    ">One disadvantage of self-learning is that you are not challenging yourself to much and the pressure from the studying from an exam back then when you are studying. Your method should not be like studying in college. Is it more like how can I use this for this particular skill for this problem (more like skill acquisition). Chicken and egg problem. How can I apply if I don’t know what I can do? In the beginning you passive > greater active, later on passive == active, and last passive < active. Try to get a general overview on what you are learning and asked yourself why I am studying again. Ask do I need this. Even if a simple project like what you learn try to modify a little. Make sure you know the fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">Have a curiosity mindset. What is this doing? Why is doing this? What if I do this? In the end you will be the one who will be teaching yourself. Instructors, books, online courses, YouTube and etc. are tools to your means which is your end goal is to become who you want to be. Make a system, goals are good for direction. 1.01^356 = 37.78, 0.99^365 = 0.025 small changes can make a big impact from Atomic habit. Progress is not a straight line. What you reap is what you sow. If you are a better version of yourself than yesterday it’s already a win.\n",
